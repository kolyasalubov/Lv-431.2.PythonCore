The Zen of Python
1.Beautiful is better than ugly.
2.Explicit is better than implicit.
3.Simple is better than complex.
4.Complex is better than complicated.
5.Flat is better than nested.
6.Sparse is better than dense.
7.Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
8.Readability counts.
9.Although practicality beats purity.
10.Errors should never pass silently.
11.
12.
13.
14.Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
15.
16.Sparse is better than dense.
17.
18.If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
19.Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
